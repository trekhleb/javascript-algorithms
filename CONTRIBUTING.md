## 🌟 Contributing

### 📜 General Rules

- 🖋️ Follow the existing format of markdown and code as much as possible.
- 🔍 Run `npm run lint` and `npm test` before submitting your pull request.
- ✅ Ensure **100%** of your code is covered by tests.

### 🌍 Contributing a New Translation

- 📄 Create a new `README.xx-XX.md` file for your translation alongside the main `README.md`. Use [locale and country/region codes](http://www.lingoes.net/en/translator/langcode.htm) for naming (`xx-XX`), like `en-US`, `zh-CN`, `ko-KR`, etc.
- 📁 Translate any relevant sub-folders by creating `README.xx-XX.md` files in each.

### 📐 Contributing a New Algorithm

- 🎯 Keep pull requests **specific** and **focused**. For example, rather than submitting "several sorting algorithms," submit them individually, such as one PR for "Quick Sort" and another for "Heap Sort."
- 📝 Include a **README.md** file for each algorithm with a **detailed explanation** and **links to additional resources**.
- 💬 Use **comments** in your code to describe each step and clarify your logic.
