## Data Structures

A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can
be accessed and modified efficiently. More precisely, a data structure is a collection of data
values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to
the data.

a set of rules that precisely define a sequence of operations.

### Algorithms by Paradigm

An algorithmic paradigm is a generic method or approach which underlies the design of a class
of algorithms. It is an abstraction higher than the notion of an algorithm, just as an
algorithm is an abstraction higher than a computer program.

  * `B` [Rain Terraces](src/algorithms/uncategorized/rain-terraces) - trapping rain water problem
  * `B` [Recursive Staircase](src/algorithms/uncategorized/recursive-staircase) - count the number of ways to reach to the top

  * `A` [Regular Expression Matching](src/algorithms/string/regular-expression-matching)
* **Backtracking** - similarly to brute force, try to generate all possible solutions, but each time you generate next solution you test
if it satisfies all conditions, and only then continue generating subsequent solutions. Otherwise, backtrack, and go on a
different path of finding a solution. Normally the DFS traversal of state-space is being used.

  * `A` [Knight's Tour](src/algorithms/uncategorized/knight-tour)
  * `A` [Combination Sum](src/algorithms/sets/combination-sum) - find all combinations that form specific sum
* **Branch & Bound** - remember the lowest-cost solution found at each stage of the backtracking
search, and use the cost of the lowest-cost solution found so far as a lower bound on the cost of
a least-cost solution to the problem, in order to discard partial solutions with costs larger than the
lowest-cost solution found so far. Normally BFS traversal in combination with DFS traversal of state-space
tree is being used.

| **Merge sort**        | n&nbsp;log(n)   | n&nbsp;log(n)       | n&nbsp;log(n)       | n         | Yes       |           |
| **Quick sort**        | n&nbsp;log(n)   | n&nbsp;log(n)       | n<sup>2</sup>       | log(n)    | No        | Quicksort is usually done in-place with O(log(n)) stack space |
| **Shell sort**        | n&nbsp;log(n)   | depends on gap sequence   | n&nbsp;(log(n))<sup>2</sup>  | 1         | No         |           |
| **Counting sort**     | n + r           | n + r               | n + r               | n + r     | Yes       | r - biggest number in array |
| **Radix sort**        | n * k           | n * k               | n * k               | n + k     | Yes       | k - length of longest key |
