# Heap (data-structure)

In computer science, a heap is a specialized tree-based 
data structure that satisfies the heap property: if `P`
is a parent node of `C`, then the key (the value) of `P` 
is either greater than or equal to (in a max heap) or 
less than or equal to (in a min heap) the key of `C`. 
The node at the "top" of the heap (with no parents) is 
called the root node.
