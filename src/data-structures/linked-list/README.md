# Linked List

In computer science, a **linked list** is a linear collection 
of data elements, in which linear order is not given by 
their physical placement in memory. Instead, each 
element points to the next. It is a data structure 
consisting of a group of nodes which together represent 
a sequence. Under the simplest form, each node is 
composed of data and a reference (in other words, 
a link) to the next node in the sequence. This structure
allows for efficient insertion or removal of elements 
from any position in the sequence during iteration. 
More complex variants add additional links, allowing 
efficient insertion or removal from arbitrary element 
references. A drawback of linked lists is that access 
time is linear (and difficult to pipeline). Faster 
access, such as random access, is not feasible. Arrays 
have better cache locality as compared to linked lists.
