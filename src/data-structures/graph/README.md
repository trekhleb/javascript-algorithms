In computer science, a **graph** is an abstract data type 
that is meant to implement the undirected graph and 
directed graph concepts from mathematics, specifically
the field of graph theory

A graph data structure consists of a finite (and possibly 
mutable) set of vertices or nodes or points, together 
with a set of unordered pairs of these vertices for an 
undirected graph or a set of ordered pairs for a 
directed graph. These pairs are known as edges, arcs, 
or lines for an undirected graph and as arrows, 
directed edges, directed arcs, or directed lines 
for a directed graph. The vertices may be part of 
the graph structure, or may be external entities 
represented by integer indices or references.
