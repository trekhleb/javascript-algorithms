In computer science, a **priority queue** is an abstract data type
which is like a regular queue or stack data structure, but where
additionally each element has a "priority" associated with it.
In a priority queue, an element with high priority is served before
an element with low priority. If two elements have the same
priority, they are served according to their order in the queue.

While priority queues are often implemented with heaps, they are
conceptually distinct from heaps. A priority queue is an abstract
concept like "a list" or "a map"; just as a list can be implemented
with a linked list or an array, a priority queue can be implemented
with a heap or a variety of other methods such as an unordered
array.
