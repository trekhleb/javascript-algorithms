In computer science, a **doubly linked list** is a linked data structure that
consists of a set of sequentially linked records called nodes. Each node contains
two fields, called links, that are references to the previous and to the next
node in the sequence of nodes. The beginning and ending nodes' previous and next
links, respectively, point to some kind of terminator, typically a sentinel
node or null, to facilitate the traversal of the list. If there is only one
sentinel node, then the list is circularly linked via the sentinel node. It can
be conceptualized as two singly linked lists formed from the same data items,
but in opposite sequential orders.

The two node links allow traversal of the list in either direction. While adding
or removing a node in a doubly linked list requires changing more links than the
same operations on a singly linked list, the operations are simpler and
potentially more efficient (for nodes other than first nodes) because there
is no need to keep track of the previous node during traversal or no need
to traverse the list to find the previous node, so that its link can be modified.

## Pseudocode for Basic Operations

### Insert

```text
Add(value)
  Pre: value is the value to add to the list
  Post: value has been placed at the tail of the list
  n ← node(value)
  if head = ø
    head ← n
    tail ← n
  else
    n.previous ← tail
    tail.next ← n
    tail ← n
  end if
end Add
```

### Delete

```text
Remove(head, value)
  Pre: head is the head node in the list
       value is the value to remove from the list
  Post: value is removed from the list, true; otherwise false
  if head = ø
    return false
  end if
  if value = head.value
    if head = tail
      head ← ø
      tail ← ø
    else
      head ← head.next
      head.previous ← ø
    end if
    return true
  end if
  n ← head.next
  while n != ø and value !== n.value
    n ← n.next
  end while
  if n = tail
    tail ← tail.previous
    tail.next ← ø
    return true
  else if n != ø
    n.previous.next ← n.next
    n.next.previous ← n.previous
    return true
  end if
  return false
end Remove
```

### Reverse Traversal

```text
ReverseTraversal(tail)
  Pre: tail is the node of the list to traverse
  Post: the list has been traversed in reverse order
  n ← tail
  while n != ø
    yield n.value
    n ← n.previous
  end while
end Reverse Traversal
```

## Complexities

## Time Complexity

| Access | Search | Insertion | Deletion |
| :----: | :----: | :-------: | :------: |
|  O(n)  |  O(n)  |   O(1)    |   O(n)   |

### Space Complexity
