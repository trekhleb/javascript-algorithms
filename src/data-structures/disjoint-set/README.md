**Disjoint-set** data structure (also called a union–find data structure or merge–find set) is a data
structure that tracks a set of elements partitioned into a number of disjoint (non-overlapping) subsets.
It provides near-constant-time operations (bounded by the inverse Ackermann function) to _add new sets_,
to _merge existing sets_, and to _determine whether elements are in the same set_.
In addition to many other uses (see the Applications section), disjoint-sets play a key role in Kruskal's algorithm for finding the minimum spanning tree of a graph.

_MakeSet_ creates 8 singletons.

After some operations of _Union_, some sets are grouped together.
