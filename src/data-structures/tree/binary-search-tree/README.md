# Binary Search Tree

In computer science, binary search trees (BST), sometimes called 
ordered or sorted binary trees, are a particular type of container: 
data structures that store "items" (such as numbers, names etc.) 
in memory. They allow fast lookup, addition and removal of 
items, and can be used to implement either dynamic sets of 
items, or lookup tables that allow finding an item by its key 
(e.g., finding the phone number of a person by name).

Binary search trees keep their keys in sorted order, so that lookup 
and other operations can use the principle of binary search: 
when looking for a key in a tree (or a place to insert a new key), 
they traverse the tree from root to leaf, making comparisons to 
keys stored in the nodes of the tree and deciding, on the basis 
of the comparison, to continue searching in the left or right 
subtrees. On average, this means that each comparison allows 
the operations to skip about half of the tree, so that each 
lookup, insertion or deletion takes time proportional to the 
logarithm of the number of items stored in the tree. This is 
much better than the linear time required to find items by key 
in an (unsorted) array, but slower than the corresponding 
operations on hash tables.
