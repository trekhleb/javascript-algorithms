# AVL Tree

In computer science, an **AVL tree** (named after inventors 
Adelson-Velsky and Landis) is a self-balancing binary search 
tree. It was the first such data structure to be invented. 
In an AVL tree, the heights of the two child subtrees of any
node differ by at most one; if at any time they differ by 
more than one, rebalancing is done to restore this property.
Lookup, insertion, and deletion all take `O(log n)` time in 
both the average and worst cases, where n is the number of 
nodes in the tree prior to the operation. Insertions and 
deletions may require the tree to be rebalanced by one or 
more tree rotations.

tree. It includes left, right, left-right and right-left rotations.
