# Tower of Hanoi

The Tower of Hanoi (also called the Tower of Brahma or Lucas'
Tower and sometimes pluralized) is a mathematical game or puzzle. 
It consists of three rods and a number of disks of different sizes,
which can slide onto any rod. The puzzle starts with the disks in 
a neat stack in ascending order of size on one rod, the smallest 
at the top, thus making a conical shape.

The objective of the puzzle is to move the entire stack to another 
rod, obeying the following simple rules:

- Only one disk can be moved at a time.
- Each move consists of taking the upper disk from one of the 
stacks and placing it on top of another stack or on an empty rod.
- No disk may be placed on top of a smaller disk.

With `3` disks, the puzzle can be solved in `7` moves. The minimal 
number of moves required to solve a Tower of Hanoi puzzle 
is `2^n âˆ’ 1`, where `n` is the number of disks.
