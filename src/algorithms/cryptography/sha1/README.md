# SHA-1 Algorithm

The SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1) is a cryptographic hash function that produces a 160-bit (20-byte) hash value, which is often represented as a 40-digit hexadecimal number. It was developed by the National Security Agency (NSA) and published by the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) in 1993 as a part of the Digital Signature Algorithm.

## How SHA-1 Works
SHA-1 takes an input message of any length and generates a fixed-size 160-bit (20-byte) hash value. The process involves several steps:

1. **Preprocessing**
   - **Padding:** The original message is padded with a '1' bit followed by enough '0' bits to make the message length congruent to 448 modulo 512. This ensures the length of the message is a multiple of 512 bits (64 bytes).
   - **Length Append:** The original length of the message (before padding) is represented as a 64-bit binary number and appended to the end of the padded message.

2. **Initialize Buffers**
   - Five 32-bit buffers are used, denoted as `H0`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, and `H4`, which are initialized to specific constants derived from the square roots of prime numbers:
     - `H0 = 0x67452301`
     - `H1 = 0xEFCDAB89`
     - `H2 = 0x98BADCFE`
     - `H3 = 0x10325476`
     - `H4 = 0xC3D2E1F0`

3. **Processing the Message in 512-bit Chunks**
   - The padded message is divided into blocks of 512 bits (64 bytes). Each block is processed through 80 rounds, utilizing bitwise operations, modular addition, and logical functions.
   - **Message Schedule Creation:** The 512-bit block is divided into 16 words of 32 bits each, which are then expanded into an 80-word schedule using bitwise operations.
   - **Main Loop:** During each round, a different logical function is applied, and the five buffers are updated using the message schedule. This process involves mixing the buffers in a complex way to produce the hash.

4. **Updating the Buffers**
   - After processing each block, the intermediate hash values are added to the existing buffer values. This process ensures that each block of the message contributes to the final hash.

5. **Producing the Final Hash**
   - Once all blocks have been processed, the final hash value is generated by concatenating the five buffers (`H0`, `H1`, `H2`, `H3`, `H4`). This results in a 160-bit (20-byte) output, typically represented as a 40-digit hexadecimal number.

## Applications of SHA-1
SHA-1 is widely used in various applications where data integrity verification is essential:
- **Digital Signatures:** It is used in digital signature algorithms to verify the authenticity and integrity of digital documents.
- **Secure Communication Protocols:** SHA-1 is integrated into protocols such as TLS/SSL for ensuring secure communication over networks.
- **Checksum and Data Integrity Verification:** It can be used to detect alterations or corruption in data files.
- **Version Control Systems:** Systems like Git use SHA-1 for identifying commits uniquely.

## How to Implement SHA-1
Implementing SHA-1 involves following the step-by-step process outlined above. Libraries in various programming languages (JavaScript, Python, C++, etc.) provide built-in support for computing SHA-1 hashes, making it easier to integrate into projects.

For example, in JavaScript, a basic implementation could involve creating functions for padding the input, initializing buffers, processing blocks, and producing the final hash. Using these functions, the SHA-1 algorithm can compute the hash of a given input string.

## How to Use This Code

- First, import the `sha1` from the directory where it is exported as a constant.

- The `sha1` object contains two methods:
  - `hash`: Takes a string as input and returns its corresponding SHA-1 hash value.
  - `compare`: Takes a string and a SHA-1 hash string, and returns `true` if the hash value of the input string matches the given SHA-1 hash; otherwise, it returns `false`.
