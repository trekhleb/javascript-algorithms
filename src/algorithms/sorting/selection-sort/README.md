# Selection Sort

_Read this in other languages:_
[_PortuguÃªs_](README.pt-BR.md).

Selection sort is a sorting algorithm, specifically an 
in-place comparison sort. It has O(n2) time complexity, 
making it inefficient on large lists, and generally 
performs worse than the similar insertion sort. 
Selection sort is noted for its simplicity, and it has 
performance advantages over more complicated algorithms 
in certain situations, particularly where auxiliary 
memory is limited.
