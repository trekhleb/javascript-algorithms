# Palindrome Check

A [Palindrome](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palindrome) is a string that reads the same forwards and backwards.
This means that the second half of the string is the reverse of the
first half.

## Examples

The following are palindromes (thus would return `TRUE`):

```
- "a"
- "pop"     ->  p + o + p
- "deed"    ->  de + ed
- "kayak"   ->  ka + y + ak
- "racecar" ->  rac + e + car
```

The following are NOT palindromes (thus would return `FALSE`):

```
- "rad"
- "dodo"
- "polo"
```
