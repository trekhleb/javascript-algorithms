# Is a power of two

Given a Real number, write a function to find if it is an integer power of the number 2, or not.

**Standard solution**

We just keep dividing the number by two, unless the number becomes `1` and every time we do so,
we check that remainder after division is always `0`. Otherwise, the number can't be a power of two.
