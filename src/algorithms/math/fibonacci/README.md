In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following
integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by
the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two
preceding ones:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers

The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;[4] this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21.

## Backtracking
Backtracking is a general algorithm for finding all (or some) solutions to some computational problem, that incrementally builds candidates to the solution.

## Memoization
In computing, memoization or memoisation is an optimization technique used primarily to speed up computer programs by storing the results of expensive function calls and returning the cached result when the same inputs occur again.

## Closures
A closure is a property of a function object by which it can access the variables outside the function or the parent scope.
