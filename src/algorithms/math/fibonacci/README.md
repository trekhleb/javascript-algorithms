# Fibonacci Number

In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following 
integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by 
the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two 
preceding ones:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;[4] this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21.
