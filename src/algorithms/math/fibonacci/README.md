In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers are the numbers in the following
integer sequence, called the Fibonacci sequence, and characterized by
the fact that every number after the first two is the sum of the two
preceding ones:

`0, 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144, ...`

A tiling with squares whose side lengths are successive Fibonacci numbers

The Fibonacci spiral: an approximation of the golden spiral created by drawing circular arcs connecting the opposite corners of squares in the Fibonacci tiling;[4] this one uses squares of sizes 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13 and 21.
