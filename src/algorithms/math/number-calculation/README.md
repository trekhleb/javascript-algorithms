 Calculate is even number
 * @description - Checking if number is even using divisibility by 2
 * 
 * If number is divisible by 2 i.e remainder = 0, then it is even
 * therefore, the function will return true
 * 
 * If number is not divisible by 2 i.e remainder != 0, then it is not even i.e odd
 * therefore, the function will return false

Calculate is even bitwise number
  * @description - Checking if number is even using bitwise operator
 * Bitwise AND (&) compares the bits of the 32
 * bit binary representations of the number and
 * returns a number after comparing each bit:
 *
 * 0 & 0 -> 0
 * 0 & 1 -> 0
 * 1 & 0 -> 0
 * 1 & 1 -> 1
 *
 * For odd numbers, the last binary bit will be 1
 * and for even numbers, the last binary bit will
 * be 0.
 *
 * As the number is compared with one, all the
 * other bits except the last will become 0. The
 * last bit will be 0 for even numbers and 1 for
 * odd numbers, which is checked with the use
 * of the equality operator.

Calculate is odd number
  * @description -> Checking if number is odd using not divisibility by 2
 * If number is not divisible by 2 i.e remainder = 1, then it is odd
 * therefore, the function will return true
 *
 * If number is divisible by 2 i.e remainder != 1, then it is even
 * therefore, the function will return false

Calculate is odd bitwise
   * @description -> Checking if number is even using bitwise operator
  * Bitwise AND (&) compares the bits of the 32
  * bit binary representations of the number and
  * returns a number after comparing each bit:
  *
  * 0 & 0 -> 0
  * 0 & 1 -> 0
  * 1 & 0 -> 0
  * 1 & 1 -> 1
  *
  * For every odd numbers, the last binary bit will be 1
  * and for even numbers, the last binary bit will be 0.
  *
  * As the number is compared with one, all the
  * other bits except the last will become 0. The
  * last bit will be 0 for even numbers and 1 for
  * odd numbers.
