**The power of a number** says how many times to use the number in a
multiplication.

It is written as a small number to the right and above the base number.

## Naive Algorithm Complexity

How to find `a` raised to the power `b`?

We multiply `a` to itself, `b` times. That
is, `a^b = a * a * a * ... * a` (`b` occurrences of `a`).

This operation will take `O(n)` time since we need to do multiplication operation
exactly `n` times.

## Fast Power Algorithm

Can we do better than naive algorithm does? Yes we may solve the task of
powering in `O(log(n))` time.

The algorithm uses divide and conquer approach to compute power. Currently the
algorithm work for two positive integers `X` and `Y`.

The idea behind the algorithm is based on the fact that:

For **even** `Y`:

```text
X^Y = X^(Y/2) * X^(Y/2)
```

For **odd** `Y`:

```text
X^Y = X^(Y//2) * X^(Y//2) * X
where Y//2 is result of division of Y by 2 without reminder.
```

**For example**

```text
2^4 = (2 * 2) * (2 * 2) = (2^2) * (2^2)
```

```text
2^5 = (2 * 2) * (2 * 2) * 2 = (2^2) * (2^2) * (2)
```

Now, since on each step we need to compute the same `X^(Y/2)` power twice we may optimise
it by saving it to some intermediate variable to avoid its duplicate calculation.

**Time Complexity**

Since each iteration we split the power by half then we will call function
recursively `log(n)` times. This the time complexity of the algorithm is reduced to:

```text
O(log(n))
```
