# Linear Search

_Read this in other languages:_
[PortuguÃªs brasileiro](README.pt-BR.md).

In computer science, linear search or sequential search is a 
method for finding a target value within a list. It sequentially 
checks each element of the list for the target value until a 
match is found or until all the elements have been searched.
Linear search runs in at worst linear time and makes at most `n` 
comparisons, where `n` is the length of the list.

## Complexity

**Time Complexity**: `O(n)` - since in worst case we're checking each element
exactly once.
