# maximum subaray sum (sliding window)

- Sliding window is an algorithm/technique used to solve
subarray/subsets problems.
- It has two types : "static sliding window(size of the window is known)
and dynamic sliding(size of the window is unknown). 
- It used to remove nested loops and reduce algorithm complexity to O(n).
