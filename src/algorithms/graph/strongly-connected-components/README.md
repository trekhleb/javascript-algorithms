# Strongly Connected Component

A directed graph is called **strongly connected** if there is a path 
in each direction between each pair of vertices of the graph. 
In a directed graph G that may not itself be strongly connected, 
a pair of vertices `u` and `v` are said to be strongly connected 
to each other if there is a path in each direction between them.
