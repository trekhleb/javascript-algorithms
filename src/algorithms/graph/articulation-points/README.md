# Articulation Points (or Cut Vertices)

A vertex in an undirected connected graph is an articulation point
(or cut vertex) if removing it (and edges through it) disconnects 
the graph. Articulation points represent vulnerabilities in a 
connected network â€“ single points whose failure would split the 
network into 2 or more disconnected components. They are useful for 
designing reliable networks.

For a disconnected undirected graph, an articulation point is a 
vertex removing which increases number of connected components.
