# Breadth-First Search (BFS)

Breadth-first search (BFS) is an algorithm for traversing, 
searching tree, or graph data structures. It starts at
the tree root (or some arbitrary node of a graph, sometimes 
referred to as a 'search key') and explores the neighbor
nodes first, before moving to the next level neighbors.
