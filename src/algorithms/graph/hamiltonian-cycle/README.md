# Hamiltonian Path

**Hamiltonian path** (or **traceable path**) is a path in an 
undirected or directed graph that visits each vertex exactly once. 
A **Hamiltonian cycle** (or **Hamiltonian circuit**) is a 
Hamiltonian path that is a cycle. Determining whether such paths 
and cycles exist in graphs is the **Hamiltonian path problem**.

One possible Hamiltonian cycle through every vertex of a 
dodecahedron is shown in red â€“ like all platonic solids, the 
dodecahedron is Hamiltonian.

## Naive Algorithm

Generate all possible configurations of vertices and print a 
configuration that satisfies the given constraints. There 
will be `n!` (n factorial) configurations.

```
while there are untried configurations
{
   generate the next configuration
   if ( there are edges between two consecutive vertices of this
      configuration and there is an edge from the last vertex to 
      the first ).
   {
      print this configuration;
      break;
   }
}
```

## Backtracking Algorithm

Create an empty path array and add vertex `0` to it. Add other 
vertices, starting from the vertex `1`. Before adding a vertex, 
check for whether it is adjacent to the previously added vertex 
and not already added. If we find such a vertex, we add the 
vertex as part of the solution. If we do not find a vertex 
then we return false.
